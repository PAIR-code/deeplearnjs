Thanks to all our contributors!

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-07

### API additions:

- Add broadcasting to NDArrayMath functions. e.g. math.add(array2d, scalar) works. Use math.addStrict(a, b) to statically enforce a and b to be of the same rank.
- Add NDArrayMath.basicLSTMCell and NDArrayMath.multiRNNCell to the math layer for inference only
- Add a TensorFlow-like API for NDArrayMath.conv2d padding, with 'SAME'|'VALID' paddings
- Add NDArrayMath.sqrt
- Add sgd momentumOptimizer

### Other features:

- math.enableDebugMode() now has console profiling for math functions:

### Internal changes:

- Add logical sampling, with a shader compiler that splices in methods for sampling in logical space, instead of sampling on 2D physical texture space. This lets us do broadcasting, and opens up the door for batching. It is also a prerequisite for integer textures to get iOS working (this will be part of the next release).

## [0.1.0] - 2017-08-04

We are so excited to finally open source this library. We can't wait to see what you build with it!
