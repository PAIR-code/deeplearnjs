- Unit test the new webgl utils
- Do profiling with many slices
- Make it work with uniforms
- Optimize CPU slice
- Make slice work for packed textures, and packedReshape
- Improve isSliceContinous to account for squeezable shapes
- Test with async reads (.data() calls)
- Test shader cache collisions with/without presense of 'offset' uniforms.
