=== TODO ===
- Unit test the new webgl utils
- Optimize strided slice when stride is 1.
- Make unstack a kernel with gradients
- Make it work with uniforms
- Optimize CPU slice
- Make slice work for packed textures, and packedReshape
- Improve isSliceContinous to account for squeezable shapes
- Replace sliceAlongAxis with unstack in tfjs-layers
